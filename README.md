# Looking Glass Dual-Monitor Example (Unity project)
This project shows a basic example of using the [Looking Glass Unity Plugin](https://lookingglassfactory.com/software/looking-glass-unity-plugin) in a blank project to create a dual-monitor application. That is, an application made with Unity that shows content on both your regular 2D monitor, as well as another screen on your 3D Looking Glass display, at the same time.

This project is just an example, feel free to use any of its code!
