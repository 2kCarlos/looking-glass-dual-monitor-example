# Looking Glass Dual-Monitor Example (Unity project)
This project shows a basic example of using the [Looking Glass Unity Plugin](https://lookingglassfactory.com/software/looking-glass-unity-plugin) in a blank project to create a dual-monitor application. That is, an application made with Unity that shows content on both your regular 2D monitor, as well as another screen on your 3D Looking Glass display, at the same time.

This project is just an example, feel free to use any of its code!

## Notes
This uses Looking Glass' Unity Plugin v1.5.0.

The custom scene used is at `Assets/Scenes/Dual Monitor Scene.unity`, which demonstrates toggling a prefab instance in the scene by clicking a button in the UI of the `Dual Monitor Scene_extendedUI` scene.

A build has been tested and should work!
